# Hytale True Backpack

A mod that allows backpacks to function more naturally and as originally intended, built using the Hytale Java plugin template.  
Originally created by UpcraftLP and slightly modified by Kaupenjoe.  
Special thanks to both authors.

I’m sharing these files because I’m not very familiar with Java or Java IDEs, but I wanted to make backpacks work in a more immersive and intuitive way.  
The repository is open for improvements and contributions.

## Original Goals

- Make backpacks wearable
- Use the game’s native UI instead of interacting with backpacks like chests
- Drop all backpack items on death, regardless of game configuration
- Remove backpack upgrade recipes so only backpack equipment is used
- Make backpacks behave similarly to shulker boxes (Minecraft)
- Add an extra inventory slot so players can equip both armor and a backpack


## Current Features

- Backpacks are wearable
- Backpacks open using the original in-game UI
- Giant backpack (36 slots)
- Backpacks behave similarly to shulker boxes (Minecraft)
